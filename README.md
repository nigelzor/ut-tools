Tools for Unreal Tournament
===========================

Windows: get the game from steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/13240/ and use a newer renderer, http://www.cwdohnal.com/utglr/ or http://kentie.net/article/d3d10drv/

OS X: get a prebuilt wineskin from http://unrealosx.webs.com/downloads.htm

Linux: winetricks + steam works, or use `install_wine.sh` and the OS X download above
